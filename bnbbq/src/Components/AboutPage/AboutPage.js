					<h1>My Beard</h1>
					<br />
					<p>
						My beard journey has started and restarted several
						times. I have let it grow out only to shave it because
						it is a rough, tangled mess. After a while, I decided to
						look into beard products, and the ones I found early on
						didn't work out for me. The skin under my beard would
						become flakey and hurt. I decided that maybe big box
						store products were not for me and started to research
						smaller companies. Once I got into small-batch
						companies, my beard thanked me. I had fewer bad beard
						days, and the skin under my beard was no longer flakey
						and sore. Fixing just those two things was huge for me,
						but the added scents and having my beard feel soft was
						another plus. My wife and daughter always complained
						about my "pokey" beard, but after using better quality
						products, that complaint has gone away. I started with
						just a couple of different scents from one company, and
						now my collection has grown, and I have several other
						companies that I plan on adding to the collection.
					</p>
					<p>
						When it comes to my preferences, I like vanilla, citrus,
						and coffee scents. I lean towards a simple scent most of
						the time, but I have come across some more complex
						scents that I do enjoy.{' '}

					<h1>My Barbeque</h1>
					<br />
					<p>
						It was well after moving out of my parent's house before
						I learned how to cook. My cooking skills on the grill
						were hotdogs and burgers; anything else was undercooked
						or overcooked. A few years back, I started to take
						cooking and grilling a little more seriously and found
						out that it is something that I enjoy doing. I started
						with a regular gas grill and used that for several
						years. It was only a couple of years ago that I began to
						teach myself how to smoke different cuts. I started with
						an electric smoker, and now I have worked up to a pellet
						smoker. My next step will be adding a charcoal smoker to
						what I have. I'm not a chef by far, and I don't ever see
						myself going to a smoking competition. I like to cook
						for family and, on occasion, have some friends over and
						have a barbeque. The best part of cooking is always
						trying new things and mixing different stuff to perfect
						a seasoning.
					</p>
					<p>
						My preferences for grilling are pork ribs, chicken, and
						salmon. I grew up on a cattle farm in Iowa, so beef and
						steaks usually aren't on my list of top things to throw
						on the grill. I had many hamburgers and steaks growing
						up, so I typically don't pass it up when I can get
						chicken or pork.
